# How Paypal and XOOM enable cex.io to steal your money legally

* cex.io does not provide paypal.
* paypal advertises prominently within its UI the XOOM wire service.
* In order to avoid having to move the funds from paypal to own bank account, I decided to use XOOM (my wrong).
* 300EUR are [send via XOOM](https://github.com/rcfa-qa/paypal-xoom-cex.io/blob/main/01%20-%20XOOM-transaction) to cex.io via wire.
* XOOM does not provide a standard "Reference" Field for a wire transfer.
* CEX.IO cannot locate the wire, requests proof-of-transfer
* XOOM provides a [proof-of-transfer](https://github.com/rcfa-qa/paypal-xoom-cex.io/blob/main/01%20-%20XOOM-transaction), without sender data
* CEX.IO says they cannot locate the payment based on the provided proof-of-transfer, needs full sender/recipient data
* CEX.IO insists on a proof-of-transfer with full sender/recipient data
* XOOM ignores my requests for such a proof-of-transfer
  * => XOOM SHOULD provide those in a self-service manner via the APP UI - they don't
* Asking XOOM to recall the wire (as suggested by CEX.IO)
* XOOM does not respond to messages anymore
* Asking paypal to refund the 300EUR and deal with XOOM
* Paypal support replies hop from one person to another, which repeat the same stuff
* Paypal sends 40EUR
* I ask paypal 5 (five) times to take the 40EUR back - they don't
* I ask paypal to escalate the issue- they don't
* Support persons change, each and everyone replying more and more with non-relevant stuff / repetitions

In the meantime, the 300EUR are nearly for 2 months at CEX.IO

Goint through the support-battle @ paypal/XOOM costs excessive amounts of time.

Involving regulators/laywers etc. is far too much effort to recover EUR300.

=> I need to back off.

=> Paypal/XOOM have assisted CEX.IO to steal 300 EURO from me.
